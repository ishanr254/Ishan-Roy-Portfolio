## Work Experience

  - **Imperial College London - Microglider Design Researcher**  
    June, 2025 - August, 2025  
    - Developed MATLAB-based aerodynamic models for a dragonfly-inspired, tailless tandem-wing 22-gram microglider.
    - Simulated a mass-shifting pitch control system using PID feedback to achieve sub-10-second stable glide recovery.
    - Ran multi-parameter design sweeps to optimize lift-to-drag ratio while maintaining static and dynamic stability.
    - Evaluated 3 trim–linearization methods, judging speed-accuracy tradeoffs to extract short-period and phugoid modes.


  - **Comarch - Forecasting Analytics Intern**  
    June, 2024 - July, 2024  
    - Delivered ML script combining individually weighted and optimized prediction models to forecast server utilization. 
    - Co-developed program to securely retrieve internal company database metrics live for the Comarch Infraspace Cloud. 
    - Troubleshooted obstacles to internal LLM implementation with the national Polish AI / ML team. 
    - Suggested future steps for integrating cloud with larger-variable forecasting models in department-wide presentation.  

  - **Cornell Engineering - Undergraduate Teaching Assistant**  
    August, 2024 - January, 2025
    - Expanded on key physics concepts from lecture twice a week, co-leading 20-person cooperative learning sections. 
    - Underwent 15-week training session focusing on differential learning, communicative responses, student engagement.

    *Propulsion Subteam Lead*    
    - Designed and implemented program to iteratively assess various propulsion and electronic system configurations. 
    - Led 6-person subteam: delegated, tracked, and supervised tasks in weekly meetings. 
    - Presented and directed subteam through 3 critical design reviews to justify design and component decisions. 
    
    *Member of the Propulsion Subteam* 
    - Planned and fabricated the electronics integration piece, justified design in 60-page competition report scoring 21st.
    - Led propeller static thrust tests, ensuring flight function on runway line in Wichita, Kansas 2024 competition.


  - **C-Salt**:  
  *Member of the Mechanical Subteam*  
    - Co-founded wave-energy student team; grew to 20 members competing in DOE’s Marine Energy Collegiate Contest.
    - Prepared comprehensive CADs of high-pressure water piston compressor for ocean-water desalination in Guam.
